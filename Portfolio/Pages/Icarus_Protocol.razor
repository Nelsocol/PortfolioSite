    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        The Icarus protocol is my senior design project, required for my major.
        In it we aim to create a game that teaches programming to students in middle school or early high school with no prior programming experience.

    <h2>Demonstrated Skills</h2>

    <h3>C#</h3>
    <h3>Python</h3>
    <h3>Unity</h3>
    <h3>Documentation</h3>

    <h2>Project Goals</h2>

    <p>
        The goal of any senior design project at Washington State University is to work with a team to undertake a long term large scale project. 
        This project is required to build to a specific client, and although my partner and I suggested this idea ourselves, we are working with our local middle school to make it relaity in the classroom.
        From a game design perspective, the goal is to produce a fun and engaging game that teaches real actionable python programming skills to those with no prior experience.
        It does this through the context of the player taking on the role of an AI that is woken up on a starship after an unknown incident. 
        The AI has to repair the software of the starship to get it back on track, and discover what happened to the ship in the first place.
    </p>

    <h2>Current State</h2>

    <p>
        Currently, the project is in its earliest phases, and the only work that has been done are the earliest initial design documents as well as the initial meetings with the client and the university.
        This portfolio page will be updated with more feature highlights and updates as the project launches fully underway.
